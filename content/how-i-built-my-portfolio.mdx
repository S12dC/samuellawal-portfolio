# How I Built My First Portfolio with React and TailwindCSS

When I first decided to become a **fullstack developer**, I knew I needed a portfolio website.  
It wasnâ€™t just about showing my projects â€” it was about learning how to build something that feels like *me*.  

## What I Used
- **React** â€“ for the component structure  
- **TailwindCSS** â€“ for fast styling  
- **Next.js** â€“ for routing and optimization  

## Challenges I Faced
- Balancing design with simplicity  
- Making the site responsive  
- Deploying it for free  

## What I Learned
1. Donâ€™t overcomplicate the design at first.  
2. Deployment is easier than it looks (thanks to Vercel).  
3. Iteration matters more than perfection.
